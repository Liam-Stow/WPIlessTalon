Driving TalonSRX motor controllers on a non-RoboRio

This uses Lunar Knight's CTRE_PhoenixPlatformLinuxSocketCan library (available at https://github.com/LunarKnights/Phoenix-Linux-SocketCAN-Example) to control TalonSRX motor controllers without the need for a roboRIO or WPILib. This is helpful if you want to use a TalonSRX for something other than the FIRST Robotics Competition. 

I'm trying to run a TalonSRX from a Nvidia Jetson
